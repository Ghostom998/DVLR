MasonryChecker. 
by Thomas Roberts, CWA.

A program to consider the vertical load design of cavity masonry in accordance with BS 5628-1:2005.
Wall Referenced: Test_Output

Consider the Slenderness Ratio:
Thickness of Leaf 1, t1: 140.00mm
Thickness of Leaf 2, t2: 102.50mm
Height of Wall, H: 3500.00mm
Restraint condition at the top of the wall is enhanced.
Restraint factor to clause 28.3.1.1., RF: 0.75
Effective Thickness, Teff = 2(t1 + t2) / 3 = 161.67mm
Effective Height, Heff = RF*H = 0.75*3500.00 = 2625.00mm
Hence,
Slenderness Ratio, SR = Heff/Teff = 2625.00/161.67 = 16.24 [-]

Consider a Partial Safety Factor:
Construction control is normal.
Manufacture control is special.
Hence,
Partial Safety from table 4a, PSF: 3.1 [-]

Consider the characteristic loading at the top of the wall: 
Leaf 1,
  Eccentric, 
	Dead load: 15.00kN/m
	Live load: 12.00kN/m
  Concentric, 
	Dead load: 52.00kN/m
	Live load: 27.00kN/m
Leaf 2,
  Eccentric, 
	Dead load: 0.00kN/m
	Live load: 0.00kN/m
  Concentric, 
	Dead load: 24.00kN/m
	Live load: 0.00kN/m
Selfweight of Leaf 1, Ymas,Leaf1: 15.00kN/m^3
Selfweight of Leaf 2, Ymas,Leaf2: 21.00kN/m^3

Wall Length & Openings:
Length of Wall, L: 1000.00mm
Opening Width, OpWidth,Leaf1: 810.00mm
Bearing Length of member supporting Opening, BLength,Leaf1: 100.00mm
Opening Width, OpWidth,Leaf2: 910.00mm
Bearing Length of member supporting Opening, BLength,Leaf2: 100.00mm

Ultimate Line Load at the top of the wall = 1.4(Ecc,DL + Conc,DL) + 1.6(Ecc,LL + Conc,LL)
Wult,TopOfWall,Leaf 1 = 1.4(15.00kN/m + 52.00kN/m) + 1.6(12.00kN/m + 27.00kN/m) = 156.20kN/m
Wult,TopOfWall,Leaf 2 = 1.4(0.00kN/m + 24.00kN/m) + 1.6(0.00kN/m + 0.00kN/m) = 33.60kN/m

SelfWeight at 0.4H from the top of the wall:
0.4H = 0.4*3.50m = 1.40m
SW,0.4H = 0.4H*t*Ymas
SW,0.4H,Leaf1 = 15.00kN/m^3 * (140.00 / 1000)m * 1.40m = 2.94kN/m
SW,0.4H,Leaf2 = 21.00kN/m^3 * (140.00102.50 / 1000)m * 1.40m = 3.01kN/m

Load Spread Length, Lspread = BLength + 0.4H < L
Lspread Opening 1 = 100.00mm + (1.40m * 1000) = 1500.00> 1000.00mm
Therefore, Lspread Opening 1 = 1000.00m
Lspread Opening 2 = 100.00mm + (1.40m * 1000) = 1500.00> 1000.00mm
Therefore, Lspread Opening 2 = 1000.00m
